## **Description üìÉ**

- Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular casino card games in the world. It is a comparing card game between one or more players and a dealer, where players compete against the dealer but not against each other. The game is typically played with one to eight decks of 52 cards.

Objective
The main objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21. Players aim to get as close to 21 as possible.

Card Values
Number Cards (2-10): Face value
Face Cards (J, Q, K): 10 points each
Ace (A): 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more
Basic Rules
Initial Deal: Each player is dealt two cards, face-up. The dealer receives one card face-up and one card face-down (the hole card).

Player's Turn: Starting from the player's left, each player has a turn to act. Players have the following options:

Hit: Take another card from the dealer. A player can hit as many times as they want, as long as they don't exceed 21.

Stand: Keep their current hand and end their turn.

Double Down: Double the initial bet and receive exactly one more card.

Split: If the first two cards are a pair, the player can split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet. The player then plays out both hands separately.

Surrender: Some variations allow players to forfeit half their bet and end their hand immediately.

Dealer's Turn: After all players have finished their actions, the dealer reveals the hole card. The dealer must hit 
until their total is 17 or higher. Most casinos require the dealer to stand on all 17s, though some variations require the dealer to hit on a "soft" 17 (a hand containing an Ace valued as 11).

Winning: Players win if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand or if the dealer busts (exceeds 21). If a player exceeds 21, they bust and lose their bet. If the player and dealer have the same total (a push), the player's bet is returned.
